### UCS
UCS is a type of uninformed searching algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node) on the basis of path cost $g(n)$. Where $g(n)$ is the distance between a given node $n$ and the start node. The UCS explore the next node on the basis of minimum path cost. The UCS use a periority queue to manintain the forntier.
